# Deno Building a simple RESTful API
This uses Oak which is similar to Node's Express.

### This API will allow:
- Addition of new dogs
- List Dogs
- Get details about a dog
- Remove dogs
- Update a dog's age

### Using the API
Run this API using the script in the app.ts file.
Once running use a program such as Postman to test the routes that are outlined on lines 112-118 in app.ts

#### Note:
This API does not have a DB and the array is stored in memory.  This is why the file is somewhat inconvenient to read.
